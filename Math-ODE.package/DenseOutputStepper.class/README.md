A fourth class of stepper exists which are the so called dense output steppers. Dense-output steppers might take larger steps and interpolate the solution between two consecutive points. This interpolated points have usually the same order as the order of the stepper. Dense-output stepper are often composite stepper which take the underlying method as a template parameter. An example is the dense_output_runge_kutta stepper which takes a Runge-Kutta stepper with dense-output facilities as argument. Not all Runge-Kutta steppers provide dense-output calculation; at the moment only the Dormand-Prince 5 stepper provides dense output.

Dense output stepper have their own concept. The main difference is that they control the state by them-self. If you call do_step, only the ODE is passed as argument. Furhtermore do_step return the last time interval, hence you interpolate the solution between these two times points. Another difference is that they must be initialized with initialize, otherwise the internal state of the stepper is default contructed which might produce funny errors or bugs.
