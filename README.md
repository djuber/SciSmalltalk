## How to install SciSmalltalk in Pharo

The simplest way to install in Pharo is via Metacello and Gofer. 
* Bootstrap SciSmalltalk

```Smalltalk
Gofer new
	url: 'http://ss3.gemstone.com/ss/SciSmalltalk';
	package: 'ConfigurationOfSciSmalltalk';
	load.
(Smalltalk at: #ConfigurationOfSciSmalltalk) loadDevelopment.
```

All packages load into the Math-* package names.


## How to install SciSmalltalk for GitHub

* Download the last dev Pharo 1.4: https://ci.lille.inria.fr/pharo/job/Pharo%201.4/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/Pharo-1.4.zip

* Bootstrap FileTree:

```Smalltalk
  Gofer new
    url: 'http://ss3.gemstone.com/ss/FileTree';
    package: 'ConfigurationOfFileTree';
    load.
 ((Smalltalk at: #ConfigurationOfFileTree) project version: '1.0') load.
```

* Clone this repository:

```shell
  mkdir SciSmalltalk
  cd SciSmalltalk
  git clone https://github.com/SergeStinckwich/SciSmalltalk.git
```

* Attach to filetree repository and load latest packages (use correct path to your filetree download/clone):

```Smalltalk
repo := 'Add you repo path here'.
Gofer new
    repository: (MCFileTreeRepository new directory: 
                    (FileDirectory on: repo));
    package: 'Math';
    load.
```
The above instructions are incorrect. When loading from FileTree/GitHub clone, you must load each package. Load packages in order Core, Extensions, Test. Core packages are those not labelled tests or extensions. After loading all packages, please ensure that tests pass. If you think you have all the packages loaded and have failing tests, please contact me. In the meantime, though I am using github as a useful code store, I recommend installing from SS3/Metacello.
